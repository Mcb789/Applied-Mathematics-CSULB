Question 1 and example 3.2 ask to either prove or disprove statements about sequences. I had to think broadly about the statements and not just rely on a generalized statement. It shows my understanding and ability to read a statement and provide an example with satisfies the prompt. The next series of questions came from example 3.4 and asks to use the definition of a convergent sequence to show that a series converges to a value. This requires me to apply a definition to write a proof about a converging sequence. I have to fully understand the definition to further my experience and deepen knowledge. I struggle with analysis, so 3.7 is a good way for me to show my improvement with proof writing throughout the semester. This helps me to understand definitions and proper notation as I become more confident in my ability to prove mathematical statements. The last two problems continue on from the first three. I did this intentionally because I did not want to introduce new skills, as I work to strengthen the ones I have now.  "

    "The transition to critically think about mathematical statements and arguments is difficult, and there are different levels of student's progression. From the article I learned that as a student, generalizations are the default way to analyze problems, but these generalizations do not hold in a mathematical context even though they are very common in our society. We need to develop other skills and ways of thinking about analysis. The progression of student thought then follows by drawing out property abstractions from the generalization. As a whole, we are trying to move away from this approach. The fact is, making assertions from a generalization does not hold. The article highlights that students struggle with trying to shift thinking from individual problems to large scale concepts. As we develop our skills, the ability to read, understand, and apply definitions is essential. By using definitions, the student moves away from false generalizations to concrete and formal pathways of logic.  "

    "Furthermore, the article focuses on the ability of students to understand mathematical analysis. Our class is a place for us to practice these skills, and we see that through analysis and applications of definitions. The development of understanding must come from the definition itself and not from examples. “If the lecturer also provides examples, intending them to be illustrative, the student may even construct their prototype on the basis of experience with them, ignoring the definition altogether.” (pg.33) When working with convergence sequence we started with identifying what is a convergent sequence which helps with understanding the definition. We avoided working with examples, so we had experience using the definition before trying to solve problems."
